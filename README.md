# Kellogg (Python Key logger)

The following is an idea for a keylogger I designed with a friend. Granose is the current folder where the code is being worked on. Granose will hold the deployable file when said file is ready. The end goal is for an inf file to run the exe once it is downloaded. 

### What I am working on Now
Now I am going to work on this python code

### What I will work on Later
The program will be hidden. If I were to make this a trojan then I would have to create a purpose for why one would keep it open while they work. Therefore it will be hidden as an exe.

This is for educational purposes only. Yes, I know I used the word Trojan and said the program will be hidden, but I can assure anyone that this will be a mediocre attempt that will likely not be better than one that someone could buy.
