# Kellogg (Python Key logger)

The following is an idea for a keylogger I designed with a friend. Granose is the current folder where the code is being worked on. Granose will hold the deployable file when said file is ready. The end goal is for an inf file to run the exe once it is downloaded. 

## Why Kellogg
1. Key + Logger = Keylogger
```   hmmm, lets try and make it more descrete...```
2. Keylogger --> Kelogg
```   ?```
3. Kellogg's
```   Profit!```

### What I am working on Now
Now I am going to work on this python code



#### Purpose?
I am just learning how this works. Was working with it with a friend and just wanted to further my understanding of how easy it would be for someone to create a program that could be eaisly deployed. Then form there to see how easy it could be hidden and work like a trojan. It is for my educational purposes and shouldn't be taken as anything else but that.
