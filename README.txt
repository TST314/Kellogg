The python file is the only file in this repository with
acutall work. The rest are files that I do not know how
to delete. This is a Key logger which was shortned down 
to the cereal company name, Kellogg.


This idea was created with a friend of mine and is likely not better than key loggers one can buy online.
This was originally meant to run on a single computer with a running windows virtual machine. 
There was no malicious intent while creating Kellogg and is meant to be just a fun program developed with a friend.
